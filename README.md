# impossible-machine — THE MACHINE

> A dependency-driven virtual machine with no instruction pointer.

Part of **[The Impossible Computer](https://github.com/n-3-0-l-d-3-v/impossible-computer)** — a constrained computing
ecosystem built by removing assumptions ordinary computers depend on. This
repository is developed standalone and mirrored into the combined ecosystem
repo commit-for-commit.

## Status

**Phase 1 — ACTIVE**

See [tickets/](tickets/) for the live phase-by-phase ticket board and
[docs/design/](docs/design/) for constraints, invariants and architecture
decision records.

## The constraint

The machine does not use a conventional instruction-pointer-driven execution model. Instructions execute when their operand dependencies become ready, not in program-counter order.

## What the constraint forces

Fixed-size instruction encoding, bounded physical registers, explicit operand dependency tracking, deterministic scheduling, and deterministic replay.

## Research question

> How much of conventional instruction sequencing is actually necessary for useful general-purpose computation?

## Development

This is a real, tested, benchmarked systems component — not a demo. See
[docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md](docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md) for the acceptance
bar every piece of this repo must clear before it is considered complete.

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
cargo bench
```
